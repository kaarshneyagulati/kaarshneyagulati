### Student interested in Robotics • AI • Engineering  

Hi! I'm **Kaarshneya**, a high-school student exploring **Robotics, Electronics, and Artificial Intelligence**.  
Right now I’m focusing on building a strong foundation in programming and engineering and slowly creating my first set of projects.

## What I’m Learning

- **Programming:** currently learning Python and core programming concepts  
- **Robotics:** basics of how robots move, sense, and react  
- **Electronics:** simple circuits, sensors, microcontrollers (beginner level)  
- **Tools:** Git & GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, basic Linux usage  
- **Interests:** AI, autonomous systems, and practical engineering projects

_As I learn more and complete real projects, I’ll keep this section updated._

##  Projects

I’m in the process of planning and building my first projects.  
Once they’re ready, I’ll add:

- A short description of each project  
- What I learned from it  
- Links to the code (GitHub repos)  
- Screenshots or demo GIFs (if possible)

## 🎓 Learning & Courses

I’m starting to explore online courses in:

- Programming (Python, problem-solving)  
- Robotics & control  
- AI & machine learning basics  

I’ll only list specific **certificates here after I actually complete them**.
